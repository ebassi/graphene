/**
 * SECTION:graphene-gobject
 * @Title: GObject integration
 * @short_description: Types for GObject properties and signals
 * @Include: graphene-gobject.h
 *
 * Graphene optionally provides information for using its own types with
 * GObject properties and signals.
 *
 * ## Using Graphene with GObject
 *
 * In order to discover at compile time if Graphene exposes type information
 * for the GType type system, you need to check if the `graphene-gobject-1.0`
 * pkg-config file exists.
 *
 * If you're using Meson to build your project, you can use a typical
 * `dependency()` object, for instance:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="plain" -->
 *   graphene_dep = dependency('graphene-gobject-1.0')
 * ]|
 *
 * If you're using Autotools to build your project, you can use the
 * `PKG_CHECK_EXISTS` m4 macro, for instance:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="plain" -->
 *   PKG_CHECK_EXISTS([graphene-gobject-1.0],
 *                    [action-if-found],
 *                    [action-if-not-found]
 * ]|
 *
 * All the types provided by Graphene are boxed types, which means you
 * will have to use the #GBoxed API when dealing with #GValue, #GParamSpec,
 * and signal marshallers. For instance, to install a property in a #GObject
 * class that uses #graphene_rect_t, you can use:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   g_object_class_install_property (object_class, PROP_BOUNDS,
 *     g_param_spec_boxed ("bounds", "Bounds", "Bounds of an object",
 *                         GRAPHENE_TYPE_RECT,
 *                         G_PARAM_READWRITE | G_PARAM_STATIC_STRINGS);
 * ]|
 *
 * You'll then need to use g_value_set_boxed() and g_value_get_boxed()
 * in order to access the #graphene_rect_t pointer from the #GValue data
 * structure.
 *
 * Whereas for creating a new signal that has a #graphene_point_t parameter
 * you can use:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   signals[HIT_TEST] =
 *     g_signal_new ("hit-test",
 *                   G_TYPE_FROM_CLASS (object_class),
 *                   G_SIGNAL_RUN_LAST,
 *                   0,
 *                   g_signal_accumulator_true_handled, NULL,
 *                   marshal_BOOLEAN__BOXED,
 *                   G_TYPE_BOOLEAN, 1,
 *                   GRAPHENE_TYPE_POINT);
 * ]|
 *
 * ## Using Graphene via GObject introspection
 *
 * When using Graphene with another language than C, the GObject Introspection
 * bindings change the type names to the CamelCase version of the C name, minus
 * the `_t` suffix; for instance:
 *
 *  * #graphene_point_t becomes `GraphenePoint`
 *  * #graphene_point3d_t becomes `GraphenePoint3D`
 *  * #graphene_rect_t becomes `GrapheneRect`
 *  * #graphene_matrix_t becomes `GrapheneMatrix`
 *
 * There is no direct access for the low level #graphene_simd4f_t and
 * #graphene_simd4x4f_t SIMD types.
