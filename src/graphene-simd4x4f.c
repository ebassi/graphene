 * @Title: SIMD matrix
 * @short_description: Low level floating point 4 by 4 matrix
 *
 * The #graphene_simd4x4f_t type wraps a platform specific implementation of
 * a four by four matrix of floating point values, using four #graphene_simd4f_t
 * row vectors.
 *
 * Like #graphene_simd4f_t, the #graphene_simd4x4f_t type should be treated
 * as an opaque type; you cannot access its components directly, and you can
 * only operate on all components at the same time.
