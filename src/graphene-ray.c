 * @Short_Description: A ray emitted from an origin in a given direction
 *
 * #graphene_ray_t is a structure representing a ray emitted by an origin,
 * identified by a point in 3D space, in a given direction, identified
 * by a vector with 3 components.
 *
 * A common use of #graphene_ray_t is ray-casting to find which objects in
 * a 3D scene are under the coordinates of the pointer.
